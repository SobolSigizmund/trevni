Arrays
 - incorporate schema from Dremel paper into tests;
 - add tests that read subset of schema written;
 - update specification
 - implement maps

Integration with other tools:
- implement Protobuf record shredder
- implement Thrift record shredder

Improvements/Optimizations:
- implement iterator subclasses per type to avoid boxing & dispatch?
- change writer api to addRowValue(int column, T) to avoid allocations?
- add benchmarks
