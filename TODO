Arrays
 - optimize unions of a primitive with null
 - update specification
 - test writing
 - implement reading
 - test reading

Improvements/Optimizations:
- implement iterator subclasses per type to avoid boxing & dispatch?
- change writer api to addRowValue(int column, T) to avoid allocations?
- add benchmarks

Integration with other tools:
- implement Avro record shredder
- implement Protobuf record shredder
- implement Thrift record shredder
